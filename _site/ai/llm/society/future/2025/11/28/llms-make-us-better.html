<meta name="description" content="The reason LLMs are so important now is because they make us question ourselves. They are a change that makes society question itself. Suddenly we’re asking deeper questions about the value of work, what is the value of this skill I am learning? Is it innately human, because that might now be more valuable? This humanistic value is permeating and percolating across all living human beings. People are demonstrating more agency, they think more about what skills they will learn, what they’re better at because there is this new level of competition. What can I do that will not be replaced, we’re becoming better as a result of it. Now we are being thoughtful of how we are spending our time. We as a collective are still more powerful, but we must band together. We must improve our communication skills, we should let AI test us because then we test our mettle. This is a massive opportunity for growth but it is hard and it is painful, but we will be better as a result of it." />
