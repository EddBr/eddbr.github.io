Felt like it was time to. I have experienced positives of posting things on the Internet, it’s an amazing thing putting things out into the Universe. As long as I’m outputting stuff into the world, things seem to happen.</p>

<p>That sounds well and good, but my innate skepticism comes out and would say that sounds braggadocious and pretentious. Maybe this is really a platform for me to vent my thoughts and see if the Internet is an echo chamber for other people to agree with me and amplify my narcissism. Irrespective, this feels like an honest medium where I can relay my thoughts and experiences.</p>

<p>I’ve been making daily code updates for my side project ProcrastApply since the 13 March 2025 and will upload all of those posts.</p>

<p>The thing that pushed me to make the blog today is a deep distrust of ChatGPT. I’m making a website where I need to upload a PDF. I don’t know whether to parse it on the frontend or backend. My thoughts: frontend could be slow, backend PDF parsing sounds like a security nightmare. ChatGPT recommended I do it on the backend because ‘security’?? Doesn’t make sense. I’m familiar with the ELIZA effect and people ascribing ChatGPT and similar LLMs an authoritys status and I’m wary of it. I also feel like I’m losing an element of my faculty by using it for tasks such as these, but it is soooo much quicker.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[First ever public post.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
