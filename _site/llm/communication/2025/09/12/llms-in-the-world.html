    <p>LLMs are becoming the new social media. The problems we are and will encounter, the benefits and the impact on human social function. Much the same way as people now incorporate videos, photos, and Wikipedia pages as verification of their own thoughts, or enhancements to the conversation being engaged in, LLMs will take a new step. Emotions will be more effectively conveyed and we will begin to question how we ever operated without them. People will use it as a sounding board for their ideas as well as a tool to more effectively communicate themselves. Communication is a 2 way street:
In 1 direction you have the communicator
In the other you have the listener
And this switches.</p>

<p>However, there is a contextual disconnect between the idea that the listener is hearing and what the communicator is trying to convey. What seems obvious or what may cause an emotional reaction or what emotion is evoked depends on the person. To some, shouting may indicate importance, to others it means loss of control and thus insignificant. Same words in the same tone, but different interpretations. This is miscommunication.</p>

<p>LLMs offer a novel way to think outside of one’s own sphere without criticism, there are subtle ways to make a person think anew.</p>

<p>The issue is that current LLMs mirror the listener and encourage an echo chamber of one’s own thoughts. This is BAD. No good will come of this. People will get trapped further down their own personalised rabbit holes and narratives.</p>

<p>“I think this person is saying this because they’re always just in a bad mood.” -&gt; Should lead to a question or nudge such as, “Why do you think they’re in a bad mood?”
But instead will likely lead to “That sounds tough, they are always such a downer.”
I hope the trajectory changes because this technology really could offer a chance for new human-insights. Communication education impacts people’s lives and can have positive change. Companies are profit-motivated, how do we make this design decision profitable?</p>

<p>I think I’m obsessed with getting the most effective outcome from a situation and good communication is a really good method to do so. Everyone can have more from these situations.</p>

<p>I suppose this is where the cheating at life thing comes in, but I don’t think it can work. It doesn’t fix the problems LLMs engender, merely exacerbates and expands their sycophantic reach.</p>
