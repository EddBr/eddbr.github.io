First ever public post. Felt like it was time to. I have experienced positives of posting things on the Internet, it's an amazing thing putting things out into the Universe. As long as I'm outputting stuff into the world, things seem to happen.

That sounds well and good, but my innate skepticism comes out and would say that sounds braggadocious and pretentious. Maybe this is really a platform for me to vent my thoughts and see if the Internet is an echo chamber for other people to agree with me and amplify my narcissism. Irrespective, this feels like an honest medium where I can relay my thoughts and experiences.

I've been making daily code updates for my side project ProcrastApply since the 13 March 2025 and will upload all of those posts.

The thing that pushed me to make the blog today is a deep distrust of ChatGPT. I'm making a website where I need to upload a PDF. I don't know whether to parse it on the frontend or backend. My thoughts: frontend could be slow, backend PDF parsing sounds like a security nightmare. ChatGPT recommended I do it on the backend because 'security'?? Doesn't make sense. I'm familiar with the ELIZA effect and people ascribing ChatGPT and similar LLMs an authoritys status and I'm wary of it. I also feel like I'm losing an element of my faculty by using it for tasks such as these, but it is soooo much quicker.
